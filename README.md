# TigerLaunch
I am making TigerLaunch and it's source for OS X freely available once again since it's developer (Ranchero Software) has stopped development and removed download links.

What is this App?
To directly quote Macupdate.com's description of TigerLaunch:
 - TigerLaunch is an easy-to-use and easy-to-configure application launcher for OS X.It displays an Apps menu at the top of your screen listing all your applications in alphabetical order - no matter what folder they appear in.You can easily configure it to exclude applications you rarely or never launch.
 - TigerLaunch allows you to be more selective about what apps are dock-worthy, so your dock doesn't get so cluttered. It also makes it easier to launch apps that are buried in sub-folders, such as in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder. The source code is available.

You can view screenshots of my own Menu and Configuration here:
